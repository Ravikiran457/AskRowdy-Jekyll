            <p><p>In all cases, over one-half of the coursework required in a degree program must be completed at the Cape Girardeau campus, the university’s Regional Campuses and Center, or through Southeast Online. Transfer courses do not count toward meeting the residence or 600-level requirements. No more than 12 hours of transfer credit or credit older than 6 years may be applied to a graduate program. Transfer credit must be accepted by the major advisor and is applied to a program at candidacy. Before enrolling for credit at another institution, prior approval must be obtained from the major advisor. Only credit in which a ‘B’ or better was earned will be accepted for transfer. Credit for transfer is only acceptable if earned from a regionally accredited institution. For programs in education, off-campus credit earned from a non-NCATE accredited institution will not be accepted.</p>

            <p><p>Usually for grad-level courses, most of the faculty provides slides and other reference links and handouts on the course page.So, cost of each course is minimal to nil.</p>

<p>Similarly, software requirements instructions will vary from course to another. The costs are minimal as each instructor will provide you the links and download instructions for their favorite open source software or virtual machine.</p>

<p>However, you may have to get your own laptop, because most of the assignments will be online.</p>
