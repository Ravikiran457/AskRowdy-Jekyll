The primary purpose of our graduate assistantships provide opportunities to gain professional experience, academic training, and to help relieve some of the financial burden of graduate school.   

Assistantships are offered in both academic and administrative roles.  Responsibilities and eligibility for assistantships may vary among departments.  

Graduate assistantships pay a stipend of $8,860 for the academic year and cover the tuition for up to 9 credits of graduate level coursework in both the fall and spring semesters and up to 6 credits during the summer semester.
